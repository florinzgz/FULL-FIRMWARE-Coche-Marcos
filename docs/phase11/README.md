# Phase 11 Documentation Directory

This directory contains screenshots and visual documentation captured during Phase 11 Graphics Audit & Render Health Validation testing.

## Expected Files

After testing is complete, this directory should contain:

### Screenshots
1. `idle_telemetry.jpg` - Telemetry overlay during idle state
2. `acceleration_telemetry.jpg` - Telemetry during acceleration test
3. `steering_telemetry.jpg` - Telemetry during steering test  
4. `menu_telemetry.jpg` - Telemetry with menu overlay active
5. `stress_test_telemetry.jpg` - Telemetry during stress test
6. `shadow_diagnostics.jpg` - Shadow diagnostics menu screen

### Additional Documentation (Optional)
- `telemetry_data.csv` - Exported telemetry data
- `test_notes.txt` - Additional observations during testing
- Videos or additional screenshots as needed

## Usage

Screenshots should be captured during Phase 11 validation testing as specified in:
- `PHASE11_RENDER_HEALTH_REPORT.md`
- `PHASE11_QUICK_START.md`

Use a camera or phone to photograph the display showing the telemetry overlay in action during each test scenario.

## File Naming Convention

Format: `<test_name>_<description>.jpg`

Examples:
- `test1_idle_telemetry.jpg`
- `test2_pedal_telemetry.jpg`
- `test3_steering_wheels.jpg`
- `test4_speed_pedal_gauges.jpg`
- `test5_menu_overlay.jpg`
- `test6_stress_full_activity.jpg`

## Important

These screenshots provide visual proof of the telemetry metrics and system behavior during validation testing. They are referenced in the final Phase 11 report and serve as permanent documentation of the graphics pipeline certification.
